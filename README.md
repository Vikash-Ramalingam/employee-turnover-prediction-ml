# Employee Turnover Prediction using Machine Learning

This project analyzes HR data to predict employee attrition and identify at-risk employees using machine learning models. It also offers a data-driven retention strategy based on prediction probabilities.

---

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Employee attrition is costly for organizations. By analyzing HR metrics such as satisfaction level, evaluation scores, and working hours, we aim to predict which employees are likely to leave and identify patterns to help HR teams take proactive measures.

## ðŸ“Š Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
- **ML Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- **Other Techniques:** SMOTE (for class balancing), KMeans (for clustering)

---

## ðŸ§± Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Quality Checks**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation Matrix
   - Distribution Plots
   - Clustering Left Employees
3. **Feature Engineering & SMOTE**
   - One-hot encoding
   - Resampling imbalanced data
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix
   - ROC Curve & AUC comparison
5. **Retention Risk Zoning**
   - Visualizes prediction probabilities into color-coded risk zones

---

## ðŸ“Š Sample Output
- Gradient Boosting Classifier achieved best performance
- ROC AUC: ~0.89
- Output visualizations include:
  - Correlation heatmap
  - ROC Curve for all models
  - Turnover risk zones (green to red)
